     <p class="five">Narendra Damodardas Modi  is an Indian politician who has served as the 14th Prime Minister of India since 26 May 2014. Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014 and is the Member of Parliament (MP) for Varanasi. He is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right wing Hindu nationalist paramilitary volunteer organisation. He is the longest-serving prime minister outside the Indian National Congress.</p>

<p class="six">Modi had infrequently worked as a child in his father's tea business on the Vadnagar railway station platform, according to Modi and his neighbours.</p>


<p class="seven">Modi became an RSS sambhag pracharak (regional organiser) in 1978, overseeing activities in Surat and Vadodara, and in 1979, he went to work for the RSS in Delhi, where he researched and wrote the RSS's history of the Emergency. Shortly after, he returned to Gujarat and in 1985, the RSS assigned him to the BJP. In 1987, Modi helped organise the BJP's campaign in the Ahmedabad municipal election, which the party won comfortably; according to biographers, Modi's planning was responsible for the win. After L. K. Advani became president of the BJP in 1986, the RSS decided to place its members in important positions within the party; Modi's work during the Ahmedabad election led to his selection for this role. Modi was elected organising secretary of the BJP's Gujarat unit later in 1987</p>

<p class="eight">In November 2023, Modi was named the BJP candidate for prime minister in the 2024 general election. The BJP's chief campaigner was its home minister Amit Shah and President J. P. Nadda. Modi launched the party's "Modi Ki Guarantee" ("Modi's assurance")campaign ahead of the general election, against the INC's guarantees campaigns, that led to the party's enormous victories in the assembly elections of Karnataka and Telangana.</p>

<p class="nine">during the first few months after his appointment as pm, modi visited a number of countries in support of his policy, and attended the BRICS, ASEAN and G20 summits.One of Modi's first visits as PM was to Nepal, during which he promised one billion US dollars in aid. modi also made several visits to the US;this was described as an unexpected development because of the US's earlier denial of a US travel visa to odi over his role in the 2002 gujarat riots. The visits were expected to strengthen diplomatic and trade relations between the two countries.</p>
